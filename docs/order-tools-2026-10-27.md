# Order tools release notes, 27 October 2026

## Refined lines and icons (staged 27 Oct 2026, 7:31 AM, not published; includes the 26 Oct polish round)
Roneel: "what can be done to make it feel more refined, like icons, more refined lines"; "website order could just have the website icon instead of the word, walk-ins could show a person walking icon, and so forth."
- Lines: one hairline border colour, one corner size for cards, slim 3px status edges (order cards, Kitchen Next priority and Needs attention, Analytics "What to do", Treat orders), no heavy black outlines or 2px dividers, quiet shadows, a gentle lift only on tappable cards, one navy focus ring, a light press effect.
- Channel: an icon badge in lists instead of the word (globe for Website order, walking person for Walk-in, phone, chat for WhatsApp, share for Social media, building for Corporate). The name is the badge's label for hover and screen readers; the order details keep the words.
- Icons: status tags (hourglass waiting, tick done, warning late or changed, truck delivery, coins money owing, pen custom), Customers number cards (in place of the text arrow), page titles (the sidebar's icon), order date blocks, empty states.
- Numbers: even-width figures so money and counts line up; big numbers lighter (650). Tables: quiet grey header in normal case, hairline rows. Analytics number cards: one navy mark instead of four colours. Stray "·" separators removed.
- Cake Heartbeat and Daily Cake Demand: excluded; computed styles checked identical with and without the change (601 elements).
- Commit c19c61fe. Webflow `ccOrderToolsLoader15` replaces loader 14 (eight files, live file check passed).
- Checks: test_polish.cjs 77 of 77, test_service.cjs 39 of 39, on phone, tablet and computer.
- Rollback: loader 13 (last published) back on the staff page and publish.
